## How to start the project
 Run the following script locally
```
npm install --ignore-scripts
npm run dev
```


## Techno used
React - Redux - Semantic ui - poi js 

## What could be improved

### Unit test
In the real world, I would write unit test on the logic/data manipulation to ensure everything works fine using 
library such as Jest for assertion.

### Error handling
In the real world, stuff break, and you cannot always expect things to run smoothly so error handling is necessary, 
but we are in the magical land of Equestria so everything should be fine :) 

### Folder structure
As this project is rather small the folder structure is different from what I would do normally. I normally work on 
a "feature" base folder structure, trying to keep every related files in the same folder (types, slices, component).
